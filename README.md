# Hi I am Antonio ðŸ‘‹
## Are you wondering who I am?
I am a developer with a strong passion for 3D and interactive applications. I've worked in a lot of different projects includying AR, VR, videogames and even animation films. And which I enjoy of that is to learn new stuff every day.

## My professional experience:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Skydance Animation Madrid as Technical Director since 2020.
    -  Here I create and maintain tools so artists can do and deliver their work.
    -  I program in python for the different softwares of the studio (Maya, Houdini, Photoshop, Shotgrid,...)
    -  Testing and debugging are some of my daily tasks for ensure the proper working of the tools.
    -  And when code is ready for production I use jenkins for delivering it.
    -  I'm always reading tickets and in communication with artists and production people in order to make the show go ahead.
- Before that I worked in my own studio (Nimoria Studio) which I founded with my college Jaime. We were doing AR app, videogames and a lot of different projects.
    - In Nimoria I was in charge of the Technical side of every project.
    - It was really fun doing research and develompent for interactive projects.
    - I used also Houdini and Maya for creating game fx and procedural art for our projects.
    - I set up Unity projects trying to make Jaime's artistic work more easy and automating the boring part for him.
    - We didn't work just in Unity. I researched a lot of technologies like 8thWall, Spark AR, Snapchat Lens Studio, usdz for web AR, Three.js,...
- Escuela CES also offered me an interesting AR project in 2017. Where I was working in an AR visualization app during 3 months.
    - It was a good opportunity for consolidating my previous knowledge of augmented reality
    - It allowed me to create a full AR experience in which user was able to visualize furnitures in place, move, rotate, scale them and change their colours and materials.
- In 2016 I started my adventure in videogames, AR and VR working as developer and 3D generalist for Iceblink.
    - For them I created a level for a zombies VR game and improved existing level. I programmed new mechanics, created 3D art, improved the performance optimizing assets and lighting and even created animatics.
    - I also worked in different AR projects, includying the Music and Dealer app which had an interactive map, a guide for the event and allowed users to take funny pictures with instruments using Music And Dealers merchandising shirts.
    - Here I learned how to deal with shaders and camera setup for creating different types of experiences like AR portals.

## We never end learning:
- I'm currently studying Multimedia Degree in UOC University since 2020. This allows me to continue consolidating my knowledge meanwhile I work.
- I made Houdini vfx master in CICE from 2017 to 2018. Where I learnded how to create procedural 3D and 2D art and visual effects. This course was very revealling for me, because It allowed me to know geometry and volumes at low levels. I made my master's final practice with Unreal Enging of course, because It is a enginge with a a great connectivity with Houdini and I was still interested in realtime. So it was a great oportunity for learning how to use shadergraph and create different fx and procdural modelling tools with houdini.
- I got the Certificate of Higher Education in 2D/3D, Animation, Games and Interactive Environments in Esccuela CES (2014-2016). Where I learned how to programm in Unity, create 3D and 2D content and develope entire videogames and applications.
