# Hi I am Antonio 👋
## Are you wondering who I am? 👨
I am a **developer** with a strong passion for **3D and interactive applications**. I've worked in a lot of different projects includying **AR, VR, videogames and even animation films**. And which I enjoy of that is to learn new stuff every day.

## My professional experience: 📎

### 🌠 I’m currently working on **Skydance Animation Madrid** as **Technical Director** since 2020.
    -  Here I create and maintain tools so artists can do and deliver their work.
    -  I program in python for the different softwares of the studio (Maya, Houdini, Photoshop, Shotgrid,...)
    -  Testing and debugging are some of my daily tasks for ensure the proper working of the tools.
    -  And when code is ready for production I use jenkins for delivering it.
    -  I'm always reading tickets and in communication with artists and production people in order to make the show go ahead.

### 🚀 Before that I worked in my own studio, **Nimoria Studio**, which I founded with my college Jaime. We were doing AR app, videogames and a lot of different projects.
    - In Nimoria I was in charge of the technical side of every project --> **Developer/Rigger/Technical Artist/**...
    - It was really fun doing **research and develompent** for interactive projects.
    - I used also **Houdini** and **Maya** for creating **game fx** and **procedural art** for our projects.
    - I **set up Unity projects** trying to make Jaime's artistic work more easy and **automating** the boring **tasks** for him.
    - We didn't work just in Unity. I researched a lot of technologies like **8thWall, Spark AR, Snapchat Lens Studio, usdz for web AR, Three.js,...**

### 🏢 **Escuela CES** also offered me an interesting AR project in 2017. Where I was working in an **AR visualization app**.
    - It was a good opportunity for consolidating my previous knowledge of **augmented reality**.
    - It allowed me to create a full AR experience in which user was able to visualize furnitures in *place, move, rotate, scale them and change their colours and materials.

### 🌅 In 2016 I started my adventure in **videogames, AR and VR** working as **developer and 3D generalist** for **Iceblink**.
    - For them I created a level for a **zombies VR game** and improved existing level. I programmed new **mechanics**; created **3D art**; improved the **performance**, optimizing assets and lighting; and even created animatics.
    - I also worked in different **AR projects**, includying the Music and Dealer app which had an interactive map, a guide for the event and allowed users to take funny pictures with instruments using Music And Dealers merchandising shirts.
    - Here I learned how to deal with **shaders and camera setup** for creating different types of experiences like **AR portals**.

## We never end learning: ✏️
### 🏆 I'm currently studying **Multimedia Degree** in **UOC University** since 2020. 
This allows me to continue consolidating my knowledge meanwhile I work.

### 🎆  I made **Houdini VFX Master** in **CICE** from 2017 to 2018. 
Where I learned how to create **procedural 3D and 2D art and visual effects**. This course was very revealling for me, because It allowed me to **know geometry and volumes at low level**. I made my master's final practice with **Unreal Engine** ,of course, because It is a engine with a fantastic connectivity with Houdini and I was still interested in realtime. So it was a great oportunity for learning how to use **shadergraph** and create different **effects and procedural modelling tools** with houdini.

### 👾 I got the **Certificate of Higher Education in 2D/3D, Animation, Games and Interactive Environments** in **Escuela CES** (2014-2016). 
Where I learned how to **programm in Unity, create 3D and 2D content and develop entire videogames and applications**.
